# Rush üèÉ
**A Minimalistic Bash Task Runner**

![img](./img/rush-example.png)

**Run all your task automation **Bash commands** from a single `rushfile.yml` file.**
</div>


* You can you ignore task execution by adding `//` before taskname in the `rushfile.yml`


## Features
* Supports all bash commands
* By default, runs commands in interactive mode
* Highlights the commands as they get executed
* Option to catch or ignore command errors
* Option to show or supress command outputs
* Command chaining is supported (See the example `rushfile.yml` where `task_2` is chained to `task_1`)
* Individual tasks can be ignored

## Installation

```
$ pip3 install rush-cli
```

## Workflow

* Here is an example `rushfile.yml`. It needs to reside in the root directory:

    ``` yml
    task_1: |
        echo "task1 is running"
        ls

    task_2: |
        # Task chaining [task_1 is a dependency of task_2]
        task_1
        echo "task2 is running"

    task_3: |
        l -a
        echo "task_3 is running"

    //task_4: |
        # Ignoring a task [task_4 will be ignored while execution]
        ls | grep "ce"
        ls > he.txt1

    task_5: |
        # Running a bash script from rush
        ./script.sh

    ```

* See all the available options
    ```
    $ rush --help
    ```
    This should show:

    ![img](./img/rush-help.png)

* Run all tasks
    ```
    $ rush
    ```

* Run specific tasks
    ```
    $ rush task_1 task_4
    ```
* Run tasks non interactively (supress the outputs)
    ```
    $ rush --hide-outputs
    ```
* Run tasks without printing individual commands
    ```
    $ rush task_1 task_2 --hide-commands
    ```

* Run tasks ignoring errors
    ```
    $ rush --ignore-errors
    ```

* View tasks without running
    ```
    $ rush --view-tasks
    ```

* View individual tasks without running
    ```
    $rush task_2 --view-tasks
    ```

## Quirks

* Rush runs all the commands using `/usr/bin/bash`. So shell specific syntax with other shebangs might throw error. In these cases, I encourage you to create dedicated shell scripts with proper shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env bash`) and add those as tasks in the rushfile.
